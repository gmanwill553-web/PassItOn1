# âœ… Database Connection Fixed!

Your authentication system is now properly configured to work with your existing Supabase database at `https://sfbjtumnvjhjhdderaiv.supabase.co`.

## ðŸ”§ What Was Fixed

### Database Schema Discovery
Your students table has these columns:
- `STUDENT ID NUM` - Student ID number
- `FIRST NAME` - Student's first name  
- `LAST NAME` - Student's last name
- `STUDENT EMAIL ADDRESS` - Student's email address

### Updated Authentication System
- **AuthContext**: Now uses `STUDENT EMAIL ADDRESS` column for email validation
- **DatabaseTest**: Displays students with correct column names
- **EmailValidationTest**: Uses the updated validation logic

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works Now

1. **Email Validation**: Checks `STUDENT EMAIL ADDRESS` column in your students table
2. **Sign-Up Process**: Only emails in your students table can create accounts
3. **Database Display**: Shows student info with correct field names

## ðŸš€ Ready to Test!

Your authentication system is now properly connected to your existing students table. You can:

1. **Visit** `http://localhost:8081/`
2. **Click "Test Students Table"** to see your existing students
3. **Use "Test Email Validation"** with emails from your students table
4. **Try signing up** with a student email from your database

The system will now correctly validate against your existing `STUDENT EMAIL ADDRESS` column! ðŸŽ‰
