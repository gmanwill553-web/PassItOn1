# Authentication Setup Complete! 🔐

Your Supabase authentication system is now fully integrated with student email validation. Here's what's been implemented:

## ✅ What's Been Created

### 1. Authentication Context (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)
- Manages user authentication state throughout the app
- Provides sign-in, sign-up, and sign-out functionality
- Validates student emails against the `students` table
- Handles session management and auth state changes

### 2. Authentication Components
- **`AuthForm.tsx`** - Sign-in/sign-up form with email validation
- **`UserProfile.tsx`** - User profile display when signed in
- **Updated `Navbar.tsx`** - Shows auth state with user avatar and dropdown

### 3. Database Integration
- **`database-setup.sql`** - SQL script to create the students table
- Email validation against the `students` table
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data protection

## 🚀 How It Works

### Student Email Validation
1. When a user tries to sign up, the system first checks if their email exists in the `students` table
2. Only emails found in the `students` table can create accounts
3. This ensures only registered students can access the platform

### Authentication Flow
1. **Sign Up**: Email validation → Supabase signup → Email confirmation
2. **Sign In**: Direct Supabase authentication
3. **Sign Out**: Clears session and redirects

## 📋 Setup Instructions

### 1. Create the Students Table
Run the SQL script in your Supabase dashboard:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of database-setup.sql
-- This creates the students table with sample data
```

### 2. Add Your Student Emails
Replace the sample emails in the SQL script with your actual student emails:

```sql
INSERT INTO students (email, first_name, last_name, university, student_id) VALUES
('student1@youruniversity.edu', 'First', 'Student', 'Your University', 'STU001'),
('student2@youruniversity.edu', 'Second', 'Student', 'Your University', 'STU002'),
-- Add more students as needed
ON CONFLICT (email) DO NOTHING;
```

### 3. Test the Authentication
1. Visit your app at `http://localhost:8081/`
2. Try signing up with a non-student email (should fail)
3. Try signing up with a student email (should work)
4. Sign in with your created account

## 🔧 Customization Options

### Add More Student Fields
```sql
ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN major TEXT;
ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN graduation_year INTEGER;
```

### Customize Validation Rules
Modify the `isStudentEmail` function in `AuthContext.tsx` to add custom validation logic.

### Add Role-Based Access
```sql
ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN role TEXT DEFAULT 'student';
-- Add admin, moderator roles as needed
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Email not found in student database"**
   - Make sure the email exists in the `students` table
   - Check that the email is lowercase in the database

2. **Authentication errors**
   - Verify your Supabase URL and anon key are correct
   - Check that RLS policies are properly configured

3. **Database connection issues**
   - Ensure the `students` table exists
   - Check that the table has the correct structure

## 🎉 Next Steps

Your authentication system is ready! You can now:

1. **Add more students** to the database
2. **Create protected pages** that require authentication
3. **Build book exchange features** with user-specific data
4. **Add user profiles** with additional information
5. **Implement role-based permissions** for different user types

The foundation is solid and ready for your university text exchange platform! 🚀
